This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Modifications

The structure of the project has been altered to more closely resemble the architecture layout out by [Bulletproof React](https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react). This includes moving page components into their respective feature directories.

## Additions

Some boilerplate packages and workflows have been added to speed up the beginning stages of development. These include:

- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting
- [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/) with [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) for automatic linting when making commits
